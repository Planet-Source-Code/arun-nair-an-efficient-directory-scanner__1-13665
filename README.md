## An Efficient Directory Scanner


</div>

### Description

Hello Friends, I'm back this time with another COM which scans for directories/folder. Many will appreciate this effort simply because this COM searches for folders and subfolders from a given path and populating it in an array. Some of you may ask "Well ...so what's new? ...aren't there applications that already do that?" ... my answer is YES, there are others too ...but maybe not as efficient or fast as this one. This COM uses the "iterative flag check" algorithm to eliminate redundant entries and also avoid skipping over unchecked paths. Besides, this is a COm ...so you can now use it along your VB/VBA/ASP application ...with the ease of just a few lines of coding!!

To try an example of its efficiency,I'd suggest that you start a "Standard EXE Application" in VB, reference(Project->References) this component(ArunSysUtils.dll), add a command button and a list box.

You will find a demo project that uses the COM called Client.vbp
